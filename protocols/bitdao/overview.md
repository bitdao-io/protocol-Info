**BitDAO is one of the world's largest DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Our vision is open finance and a decentralized tokenized economy. â€ŒBitDAO is a protocol governed by BIT token holders. We welcome all individuals and communities to join us and contribute.**

[BitDAO](https://www.bitdao.io/) is a DAO with billions in existing assets and billions in forecasted contributions.
BitDAO aims to support builders of the decentralized economy. It is an open platform for proposals that are voted upon by BIT token holders. It is agnostic to chains and projects.
Possible proposals include 1) direct partnerships or swaps with projects, and 2) expansion via specialized autonomous entities such as: ecosystem funds, artist guilds, farming cooperatives, R&D Labs, etc.
BitDAO is supported by Peter Thiel, Founders Fund, Pantera, Dragonfly, Spartan, Bybit, and [more](https://docs.bitdao.io/partners/early-partners).
